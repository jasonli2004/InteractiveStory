# Interactive Story Web Page 🌟

This project offers an engaging and interactive life story experience where users can make choices that lead to diverging life paths and outcomes. Designed as a personal project, it was showcased during the final closing ceremony of my study abroad program. The project was rapidly developed over two days and is a proof of concept rather than a fully refined web application.
